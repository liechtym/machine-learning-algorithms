# machine-learning-algorithms
All of the algorithms contained in the repository were written by Matthew Liechty as part of university classwork. This work was published on this repository with the knowledge and consent of the instructor.

One particular file in the ID3 folder was written by class instructors and was included with consent from the original authors.

Data used to run on these alogrithms was derived from the [liblinear repository](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/), and modified heavily by course instructors for educational purposes. All data has been removed from this repository, but the code originally used to run metrics for the datasets has been included.
