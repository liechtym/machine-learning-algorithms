# machine-learning-algorithms
All of the algorithms contained in the repository were written by Matthew Liechty for the Fall 2018 Machine Learning class at the University of Utah, taught by Vivek Srikumar. A couple resources were written by course instructors and were included with consent. These particular files are labeled with a comment at the top.

Data used to run on these alogrithms was derived from the [liblinear repository](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/), and modified heavily by course instructors for educational purposes. All data has been removed from this repository, but the code originally used to run metrics for the datasets has been included.
