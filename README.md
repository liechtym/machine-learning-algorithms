# machine-learning-algorithms
All of the algorithms contained in the repository were written by Matthew Liechty as part of university classwork.

Data used to run on these alogrithms was derived from the [liblinear repository](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/), and modified heavily by course instructors for educational purposes. All data has been removed from this repository, but the code originally used to run metrics for the datasets has been included.
