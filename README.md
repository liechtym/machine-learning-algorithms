# machine-learning-algorithms
All of the algorithm implementations contained in the repository were written by Matthew Liechty as part of university classwork. This work was published on this repository with the knowledge and consent of the instructor.

Data used to run on these alogrithms was derived from the [liblinear repository](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/), and modified heavily by course instructors for educational purposes. All data has been removed from this repository.
